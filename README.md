# Schistosomiasis signature reversal analysis

This repository contains exploratory work carried out as a collaboration between the [IMPM](https://www.impm-cm.org/) (Yaoundé, Cameroon) and Ersilia. The goal of this project is to investigate molecular signatures and potential reversal strategies for schistosomiasis.

## Summary

We obtained several transcriptomics signatures corresponding to schistosomiasis patients in Cameroon. We use signature reversal strategies to identify drugs or potential perturbations capable of correcting these signatures to a normal-like state.

Below is a list of the relevant meetings related to this project:

- [Meeting on 2026/01/22](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z88zAV2UfMG7pAyBZMsNGaGiCE5uibKlxmEO6KpUY1k/edit?usp=sharing): First analysis on L2S2. It contains a brief quantification of the signatures provided, and a quick query to the L2S2 signature reversal server. It contains [natural products](https://github.com/ersilia-os/impm-natural-products) data analysis as well.
